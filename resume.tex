\section*{EXPERIENCE}

        \employer{Eluvio}{Berkeley, CA}{Cryptosystems Engineer}{June 2020 --- August 2020, October 2021 --- \textit{Current}}
          \begin{accomplishments}
            \item Built a high security key-management system using AMD SEV.
            \item Designed and implemented a prototype consumer{\textendash}scale, identity{\textendash}based asset access scheme to allow content secured by an ethereum{\textendash}backed system to be securely and efficiently managed. 
          \end{accomplishments}

        \employer{Hyperion Maritime}{Nantucket, MA}{Race Crew \& Deckhand --- Santana}{June 2021 --- August 2021}
            \begin{accomplishments}
              \item Raced and maintained Santana, a classic 55' yawl built in 1935 by Sparkman \& Stevens.
            \end{accomplishments}

        \employer{UC Berkeley}{Berkeley, CA}
            {Undergraduate Student Instructor \& RL Researcher}{August 2018 --- May 2021}
              \begin{accomplishments}
                \item Taught undergraduates taking discreet math and probability theory (CS70) in person and virtually, including topics such as Galois Field Theory, Countabililty, Berlekamp-Welsh, and Probability Theory. Held office hours, proctored, and graded exams.
            \end{accomplishments}

        \employer{Procore Technologies}{Santa Barbara, CA}
                {Machine Learning Intern}
                {June 2019 --- August 2019}
                    \begin{accomplishments}
                        \item Combined supervised image encoding with a Gaussian clustering algorithm in order to find latent classes in a dataset of construction images. 
                          This successfully produced a low-noise dataset 8x larger than any existing dataset and greatly increased model performance.
                    \end{accomplishments}
