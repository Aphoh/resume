\section*{EXPERIENCE}

        \employer{Eluvio}{Berkeley, CA}{Cryptosystems Intern}{June 2020 --- August 2020}

                  \begin{accomplishments}
                \item Built a key{\textendash}splitting and distributed trust scheme to secure high value assets in a federated system.
                \item Designed and implemented a prototype consumer{\textendash}scale, identity{\textendash}based asset access scheme to allow content secured by an ethereum{\textendash}backed system to be securely and efficiently managed. 
                  \end{accomplishments}

        \employer{Procore Technologies}{Santa Barbara, CA}
                {Machine Learning Intern}
                {June 2019 --- August 2019}
                    \begin{accomplishments}
                        \item Combined supervised image encoding with a Gaussian-based clustering algorithm in order to find latent classes in a dataset of construction images. 
                          This successfully produced a low-noise dataset 8x larger than any existing dataset and greatly increased model performance.
                    \end{accomplishments}

        \employer{UC Berkeley}{Berkeley, CA}
            {Undergraduate Student Instructor \& RL Researcher}{2018 --- current}
                  \begin{accomplishments}
                \item Taught undergraduates taking discreet math and probability theory (CS70) in person and virtually, including topics such as Galois Field Theory, Countabililty, Berlekamp-Welsh, and Probability Theory. Held office hours, proctored, and graded exams.
                \item Developed an RL Agent controller for Demand Response in energy grids, working in Prof. Costas Spanos' group. Developed novel techniques to improve the agent's fairness and speed of learning using uniform quadric sampling and surprise minimization.
                  Publications pending experiment at SinBerBEST in Singapore, beginning in March 2021.
                \end{accomplishments}
